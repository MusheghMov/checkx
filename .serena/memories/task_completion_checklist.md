# Task Completion Checklist

## When completing coding tasks:

### 1. Code Quality
- Run `pnpm compile` to check TypeScript types
- Format code with `prettier --write .`
- **No linting currently set up** - only Prettier formatting available

### 2. Build Verification
- Run `pnpm build` to ensure Chrome build works
- Run `pnpm build:firefox` if Firefox compatibility is needed
- Check that no build errors occur

### 3. Development Testing
- Run `pnpm dev` to test in development mode
- Verify extension loads properly in browser
- Test functionality in browser extension context

### 4. Environment Variables
- Ensure all required environment variables are set
- Verify Clerk authentication works if auth-related changes were made

### 5. No Automated Testing
- **No test framework currently set up**
- Manual testing in browser extension environment required

## Note
This project currently has minimal tooling setup - only Prettier for formatting and TypeScript compilation. Consider adding ESLint and testing framework for better development experience.
